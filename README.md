# Tech-Academy-Projects
This repository is for my Tech Academy Projects. By the end of this course (Roughly Jan-Feb 2023) this repository should include a 
variety of basic projects using HTML & Javascript. I will likely be personalizing individual projects as inspiration strikes and using some as portfolio items in my professional career.

For those like me who are new to the developer role feel free to peruse and use any code you find here at your leisure. I will also try to answer any questions but as newbie I can't promise what I have to say will be terribly insightful.
